			**********DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES**********

The aim of this project is to develop a data  acquisition for small unmanned aerial vehicles using the Arduino
boards. 

The system is capable of reading the UAVs altitude and GPS location and transmit them to the ground station.
At the ground station this data is proccessed and displayed using a Python script. An antenna tracking mechanism 
has also been integrated at the ground station usnig the real time data received.

The ground station can also send commands to the UAV to perform control actions on-board. The required commands and 
correspoding actions can be easily configured by adding them to the on board system and the ground station script.
